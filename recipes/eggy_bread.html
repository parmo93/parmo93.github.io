    <p>The simplest of indulgent breakfast recipes.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"/>

    <p>Serve our eggy bread by itself, with an oozy fruit compote or as part of a traditional fried breakfast</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>2 slices white bread or brown bread</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly beat the egg in a shallow bowl along with the milk. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, making sure it has soaked up all of the liquid. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around the pan and when it's beginning to foam, add the bread and fry on each side for 1 min or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate and serve with crispy bacon or fruit compote.</li>
    </ol>
